# Build WebRTC apps fast with React & Twilio Video SDK

[Presentation for FEMUG meetup #1 @ audibene, Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/femug-berlin/events/285819726/)

---

To install dependencies, please run `yarn` or `npm i`.

To run the app, run `yarn dev` or `npm dev`.

Then you can visit the application in:
- presentation mode (http://localhost:3000), or 
- presenter mode (http://localhost:3000?presenterMode=true)

If you open 2 windows in the same browser (for some reason), you should see both modes working and presenter being able to control presentation. ðŸŽŠ

Have fun reading! ðŸš€
